### **Day 1 - [03.09.25]**
**Hours Worked**: 4-5 hours
**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Set up new directory structure (src/core, src/analysis, src/output, src/ui, src/utils)
- [x] Create tests directory structure with proper organization
- [x] Move existing files to appropriate locations in new structure
- [x] Create basic data models (SwimmingMetrics, GarminMetrics, SwimmingSession, SwimmingInterval)
- [x] Set up core module with clean imports and __init__.py
- [x] Fix circular import issues in models and core module
- [x] Add basic test coverage (test_imports_work, test_models_work, test_basic_structure)
- [x] Resolve import path issues and get all basic tests passing
- [x] Fix directory naming confusion (rename src/output to src/exporters)
- [x] Move main.py to correct location (src/ root, not src/core/)
- [x] Clean up architecture: core=data, exporters=output logic, main=CLI
- [x] Commit major refactoring progress and push to remote

**Challenges Faced**:
- Circular import issues when trying to import complex models in __init__.py
- Import path problems when running tests (absolute vs relative imports)
- Confusion about where to place exceptions.py (root vs core level)
- Naming confusion between src/output (code) and output/ (generated files)
- Git not detecting tests due to import path issues
- main.py was moved to wrong location during initial refactoring

**Solutions Found**:
- Simplified core __init__.py imports to avoid circular references
- Used relative imports (..exceptions) instead of absolute imports (src.exceptions)
- Placed exceptions.py at root src/ level for access by all modules
- Renamed src/output to src/exporters to clarify it's source code, not generated files
- Moved main.py back to src/ root where it belongs
- Fixed .gitignore to ignore generated files (output/) but track source code (src/, tests/)
- Ran tests from project root to resolve Python path issues

**Tomorrow's Goals**:
- [ ] Extract authentication logic from main.py to core module
- [ ] Move orchestration logic from main.py to orchestration module
- [ ] Clean up main.py to contain only CLI logic
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for extracted functionality
- [ ] Continue with Week 1 refactoring plan
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass after each refactoring step

**Key Learnings**:
- Relative imports (..exceptions) work better than absolute imports (src.exceptions) in modular code
- __init__.py files should import only what's needed to avoid circular dependencies
- Directory naming matters - exporters is clearer than output for source code
- Always run tests from project root to avoid Python path issues
- Structure refactoring should be done incrementally with testing at each step
